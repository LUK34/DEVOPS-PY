# `@staticmethod` decorator

# In Python, a static method is a method that does not receive the self or cls parameter,
# meaning it does not access or modify class or instance state. It's like a regular function,
# but lives inside the class's namespace for organizational purposes.

# Key Characterstics:
# Doesn't take self or cls as the first argument.
# Cannot access or modify class or instance variables.
# Used when the method logic is related to the class, but doesn't need to access class or instance data.

# When to use:
# The logic is related to the class conceptually.
# The method doesnâ€™t need to access or change object or class state.
# You want to keep utility functions grouped inside a class.
